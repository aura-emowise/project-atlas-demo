Build Your Map of Reality. An interactive, gamified platform to master the art of clear thinking.



This project is a fully functional prototype developed for a hackathon, demonstrating a novel approach to cognitive training through mental models.



üî¥ The Problem
In a world of information overload and pervasive misinformation, the ability to think critically is no longer a soft skill‚Äîit's a survival tool. 
Yet, we are rarely taught how to think. We are left to navigate a complex reality with minds full of biases and outdated assumptions, 
leading to poor decisions and increasing polarization.


üü¢ The Solution
Project: Atlas is a "gymnasium for the mind." It doesn't teach you what to think; it trains you how to think.
Through a gamified, level-based journey, users learn and apply powerful mental models from science, philosophy, and economics. 
Interactive labs transform abstract concepts into intuitive, practical skills. The ultimate goal is to build a robust internal "map of reality,"
 enabling users to make better decisions with clarity and confidence.

‚ú® Key Features
Gamified Skill Tree: A motivating, level-based progression system that visually tracks your journey.

Interactive Labs: Apply concepts like Occam's Razor and First-Principles Thinking in practical scenarios.

Achievement System: Earn stars ‚≠ê for completing levels, reinforcing progress and motivating completion.

Final Certification: A verifiable "Certificate of Cognitive Competence" awarded upon full course completion.

Modular & Scalable: The architecture allows for easy addition of new levels and checkpoints.

Clean & Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, intuitive user experience.
